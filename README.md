# Mobility-Model
Code for getting figures, tables, and other results from manuscript submitted

This repository contains code for running the model described in Schaber et. al. (in press).

In order to run the model, use file 'runInfectionsOverTime_all.R'. 
All necessary functions, variables, etc. are included in the other files.

To get output values for the sensitvity version of the full model with movement on days 1-3, 
run the file 'new_out_code.R'. 
Slight changes to this code can provide outputs for the other version of the full model.
